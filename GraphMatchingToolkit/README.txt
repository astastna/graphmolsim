We recommend the following three steps:
STEP 1:
Unzip the archive "Sources.zip", integrate the whole framework in an IDE (e.g. Eclipse) and build the project.

STEP 2:
Define a properties file in order to define the parameters of your graph matching task. In the folder 'properties' you find three examples of such properties (for more details on these parameters we refer to our paper: 
K. Riesen, S. Emmenegger and H. Bunke. A Novel Software Toolkit for Graph Edit Distance Computation.. In W.G. Kropatsch et al., editors, Proc. 9th Int. Workshop on Graph Based Representations in Pattern Recognition, LNCS 7877, 142â€“151, 2013.

STEP 3:
Run the graph matching as a java application. The main method is in "GraphMatching.java", the sole program argument is an URL pointing to the properties file (e.g.: /Users/riesen/Documents/workspace/GraphMatchingToolkit/properties/properties_molecules.prop)
