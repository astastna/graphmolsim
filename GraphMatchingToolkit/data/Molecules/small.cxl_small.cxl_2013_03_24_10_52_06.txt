Target graph set:	/Users/riesen/Documents/workspace/GraphMatchingToolkit/data/Molecules/small.cxl (5 graphs)

Graph edit distance procedure:	AStar
Edge mode:		undirected

Cost for node deletion/insertion:	3.0
Cost for edge deletion/insertion:	3.0

Alpha weighting factor between node and edge costs:	0.5

Node attribute 0:	chem;	Cost function:	discrete;	mu = 0.3 nu = 2.0;	Soft factor:	1.0

Edge Attribute 0:	valence;	Cost Function:	discrete;	Soft Factor:	1.0

Individual node costs are multiplied
Individual edge costs are added
(Combined node cost)^(1/3.0)
(Combined edge cost)^(1/1.0)
